## HolidayTracker: Streamlining Public Holiday Management

In our modern world, managing public holidays can be a complex task. With various holidays scattered throughout the year, each with its own significance and cultural context, keeping track of them all can be challenging. HolidayTracker is a web application designed to alleviate this burden by providing users with a simple and intuitive platform for organizing and managing public holidays. In this comprehensive overview, we will explore the features, functionality, user interface, and benefits of HolidayTracker in detail.

## Understanding the Need

Public holidays play a significant role in our lives, marking important events, traditions, and cultural celebrations. Whether it's a national holiday like Independence Day or a religious holiday like Christmas, these occasions often involve time off work, special gatherings, and festive activities. However, with so many holidays to remember, it's easy to lose track of them or forget important details.

This is where HolidayTracker comes in. By centralizing holiday information and providing tools for organization and management, HolidayTracker helps users stay informed, plan ahead, and make the most of their holiday time.

## Features and Functionality

- Fetching Public Holidays Data: At the core of HolidayTracker is its ability to fetch public holiday data from external sources. Leveraging APIs like the Nager.Date API, HolidayTracker retrieves a comprehensive list of public holidays for the specified year and country. This ensures that users have access to accurate and up-to-date holiday information.

- Dynamic Task Item Generation: Once the holiday data is retrieved, HolidayTracker dynamically generates task items for each holiday. These task items are displayed in a list format, providing users with a clear overview of upcoming holidays. Each task item includes details such as the holiday name, date, and actions (Mark Complete, Edit, Delete).

- Marking Tasks as Complete: One of the key features of HolidayTracker is its ability to mark holidays as complete. By clicking the "Mark Complete" button associated with each holiday, users can indicate that they have acknowledged or celebrated the holiday. This feature provides users with a visual indicator of their progress and helps them keep track of which holidays they have observed.

- Editing Task Names: HolidayTracker allows users to customize holiday names to suit their preferences. By clicking the "Edit" button for a specific holiday, users can modify the holiday name through a prompt dialog. This feature enables users to personalize holiday labels, making them more meaningful and relevant to their cultural or personal context.

- Deleting Tasks: To streamline holiday management, HolidayTracker enables users to delete holidays from the list. By clicking the "Delete" button corresponding to a holiday, users can remove the holiday entry from the application interface. This feature allows users to declutter their holiday list and focus on the holidays that are most relevant to them.
