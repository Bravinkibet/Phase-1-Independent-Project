## HolidayTracker: Streamlining Public Holiday Management
In our modern world, managing public holidays can be a complex task. With various holidays scattered throughout the year, each with its own significance and cultural context, keeping track of them all can be challenging. HolidayTracker is a web application designed to alleviate this burden by providing users with a simple and intuitive platform for organizing and managing public holidays. In this comprehensive overview, we will explore the features, functionality, user interface, and benefits of HolidayTracker in detail.

## Understanding the Need
Public holidays play a significant role in our lives, marking important events, traditions, and cultural celebrations. Whether it's a national holiday like Independence Day or a religious holiday like Christmas, these occasions often involve time off work, special gatherings, and festive activities. However, with so many holidays to remember, it's easy to lose track of them or forget important details.

This is where HolidayTracker comes in. By centralizing holiday information and providing tools for organization and management, HolidayTracker helps users stay informed, plan ahead, and make the most of their holiday time.

## Features and Functionality
- Fetching Public Holidays Data: At the core of HolidayTracker is its ability to fetch public holiday data from external sources. Leveraging APIs like the Nager.Date API, HolidayTracker retrieves a comprehensive list of public holidays for the specified year and country. This ensures that users have access to accurate and up-to-date holiday information.

- Dynamic Task Item Generation: Once the holiday data is retrieved, HolidayTracker dynamically generates task items for each holiday. These task items are displayed in a list format, providing users with a clear overview of upcoming holidays. Each task item includes details such as the holiday name, date, and actions (Mark Complete, Edit, Delete).

- Marking Tasks as Complete: One of the key features of HolidayTracker is its ability to mark holidays as complete. By clicking the "Mark Complete" button associated with each holiday, users can indicate that they have acknowledged or celebrated the holiday. This feature provides users with a visual indicator of their progress and helps them keep track of which holidays they have observed.

- Editing Task Names: HolidayTracker allows users to customize holiday names to suit their preferences. By clicking the "Edit" button for a specific holiday, users can modify the holiday name through a prompt dialog. This feature enables users to personalize holiday labels, making them more meaningful and relevant to their cultural or personal context.

- Deleting Tasks: To streamline holiday management, HolidayTracker enables users to delete holidays from the list. By clicking the "Delete" button corresponding to a holiday, users can remove the holiday entry from the application interface. This feature allows users to declutter their holiday list and focus on the holidays that are most relevant to them.

## User Interface and Experience
The user interface of HolidayTracker is designed with simplicity and usability. The application features a clean and intuitive layout, with clearly defined sections for holiday information and actions. The task items are displayed in a list format, making it easy for users to scan and navigate through the holidays.

Each task item includes interactive elements such as buttons for marking tasks as complete, editing task names, and deleting tasks. These elements are designed to be visually distinct and easily accessible, ensuring a smooth and seamless user experience.

## HTML set-up

This HTML code sets up the structure for a web application named HolidayTracker, focusing on managing public holidays. It includes a container for the application, a header displaying "Public Holidays," and a list for dynamically rendering holiday items. The application links to external CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality, such as fetching holiday data and user interactions. This setup is essential for creating a responsive and interactive web application.

## style.css set-up
It includes styles for the body, container, headings, form elements, list items, buttons, and additional styles for the task-header. The design is responsive, with a focus on readability and aesthetics. Key features include:

- A light background color for the body and a white container with rounded corners and a subtle shadow for a modern look.

- Center-aligned headings with a dark grey color for emphasis and Times New Roman font family for a classic touch.

- Form elements styled for input and submission, with a focus on usability and aesthetics.
- A grid layout for list items, allowing for a flexible and organized display of holiday information.
- Custom styles for buttons, including a distinctive green color for the "Mark Complete" button to indicate completion.

- A limit on the size of holiday images to ensure they fit well within the layout.
- Added styles for task-header to position the spans as required.

## index.js set-up
It performs several key functions:

- DOMContentLoaded Event Listener: Waits for the HTML document to be fully loaded and parsed before executing the script. This ensures that all elements are available for manipulation.

- Fetching Public Holidays: Uses the fetch API to retrieve public holiday data for the year 2020 in the US from the Nager.Date API. It then processes the data to remove duplicates based on the holiday name.

- Presidents' Day Handling: Checks if Presidents' Day is included in the fetched data. If not, it manually adds Presidents' Day at the third position in the list.

- Creating Task Items: For each unique holiday, it dynamically creates a task item (<li>) with an image, title, date, and action buttons (Mark Complete, Edit, Delete). The createTaskItem function constructs these elements and appends them to the task list.

- Interactive Features: Toggle Task Status allows users to mark a holiday as complete by toggling the completed class on the task item. Edit Task enables users to edit the name of a holiday through a prompt dialog. Delete Task provides a way to remove a holiday from the list. Image Handling uses a predefined mapping of holiday names to image URLs to display relevant images for each holiday. If an image URL is not found, a default placeholder image is used. Removing Duplicates implements a removeDuplicates function to ensure that each holiday name appears only once in the list, preventing duplicate entries.
# Conclusion
In conclusion, HolidayTracker is a valuable tool for anyone looking to simplify the process of managing public holidays. With its intuitive interface, dynamic task generation, and interactive features, HolidayTracker empowers users to stay organized, efficient, and informed about upcoming holidays.
